honestly, I'm not really sure what I was trying to achieve with this when I wrote it, but here it is if anyone wants to look at it

working features are:
- host & arduino code for autorotating a monitor using an arduino's accelerometer ([this](https://github.com/romner-set/arduino) but worse and for windows)
- cool tray icon & menu
- local computation of huge factorials, because, uh... why not?
- Blazingy Fastâ„¢ ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€
- pretty colors, even in windows' cmd somehow
